A Complex Problem Space for the Future Hybrid Team Intelligence
===============================================================

The rapid evolution of machine intelligence presents fundamental challenges to the
research and development community. First, advances in machine intelligence can
outpace the rate at which the community develops its understanding of relationship
between intelligent technologies and humans; that is, the interactions or relationships
between humans and technology studied for a particular state-of-the-art technology can
quickly be rendered irrelevant by either the significant advancement of the technology
or the rise of a superior machine intelligence. Second, the advances in intelligent
technologies are correlated with changes in human behaviors and potentially human
capabilities; for example, there are numerous negative short- and long-term effects on
human spatial reasoning resulting from GPS device use (4,9) as well as changes in human
roles (human knowledge, skills, and behavior requirements) in the aforementioned
weather forecasting and human-guided machine learning examples. This correlation
effectively points to the potential for human-machine intelligence research to be studying
the “wrong people,” which can directly impact overall performance as well as underlying
issues such as system usability and trust (see 10). We posit that overcoming these
challenges will require the combined expertise of multidisciplinary teams (of humans
and technology) with an emphasis on combining human-centric and technology-centric
expertise.

Consistent with the literature on multidisciplinary teaming (see 1, 11, 12), we have
observed that specialized perspectives, communications, priorities, and assumptions of
human-centric versus intelligent technology-centric researchers and developers can
make it quite difficult for teams to function effectively together. Our approach to
overcoming the challenges of developing high performing mixed human- and machine
intelligence-centric research and development teams starts with attempting to create a
shared vision for the future. While numerous future environments are plausible, we
constrain our vision through three “driving factors” that we extract from current
technological and sociotechnical trends:

- Advanced Intelligence: Machine intelligence technologies that sense, perceive,
  reason, and/or learn are expected to continue to become increasingly capable,
  more pervasive in society, and potentially more “alien” to humans. These
  technologies will adapt to and learn from a variety of sources including humans,
  other technologies, as well as the environment. While not as dramatic, human
  intelligence and its application is also expected to become refined with the
  continued development of cognitive enhancement technologies, training
  approaches, and continued exposure to advanced sociotechnical ecosystems.
  Sample Challenge: Create future human-technology interactions for human
  and machine intelligence that does not yet exist.
- “Superhuman” Capabilities: The continued evolution and growth of
  interconnected sociotechnical ecosystems combined with more capable data
  processing and interpretation capabilities will continue to create conditions
  where decisions are made faster and/or on more data than humans can
  effectively process through traditional means. Sample Challenge: Create future
  human-technology interactions that allow for humans to influence
  “superhuman” decisions and actions without limiting overall performance.
- Rapid Technological Change: Continued decreases in the time from ideation
  to fielding of new technologies combined with the fact that these technologies
  ave become increasingly pervasive in society has created an environment of
  constant and rapid technological change. Sample Challenge: Enable humans
  and machines to have effective and stable in-field adaptations to predicted and
  unforeseen changes in the sociotechnical environment.

Combined, these three interrelated “driving factors” constrain the complex problem
space in which we expect hybrid team intelligence to be critical. However, we have
observed that this level of constraint is still insufficient to bring together high performing
mixed human- and intelligent technology-centric research and development teams. To
help multidisciplinary teams further create a shared vision, we have attempted to
instantiate this future problem space in the simplified, toy research platform of Hybrid
Team Tetris.
