Introduction
=============

Increased hybridization of intelligence between humans and artificial capabilities is
envisioned arising from decades of rapid, pervasive, and disruptive technological
evolution (see 2,3). Herein, we focus on hybrid team intelligence, which we define as the
ability to learn or use skilled reasoning (intelligence) that arises from multi-agent, multi-human 
systems (teams) where there is a deliberate blending of the processing between
at least two disparate disciplines, cultures, or entities (hybridization). In this definition,
any specific entity does not need to be intelligent. Rather, the mixed human-agent system
overall must present the ability to learn or use skilled reasoning.

Numerous scientific and commercial breakthroughs point to disruptive
technological evolution already forming the basis for hybrid team intelligence. We give
examples of three forms of human-technology interaction: technology as a tool,
technology as a human decision enhancer, and human-guided artificial learning. Initial
disruptions came in the form of humans using tools that solve complex problems. The
creation of consumer Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices pioneered by
Garmin in the 1990s exemplifies how complex problem-solving tool use can reduce, but
not eliminate, human cognitive demand associated with specifics aspects of navigation
(see 4). Extending this form of hybrid intelligence to teams, the development of weather
forecasting models has led to a dramatically altered approach to weather forecasting
involving numerous complex models with numerous human users to generate hybrid
forecasts with less errors than models or humans alone can produce (e.g., see National
Hurricane Center). Technological advances have gone beyond human use of tools to
relationships where technologies integrate, modify, and extend human decisions. The
creation of Foldit for predicting protein structures provides an example of this form of
relationship by merging crowdsourcing with intelligent technologies for ideation and
discovery (5). The creation of cortically coupled computer vision technologies provides
another example of integrated human inputs by combining brain-computer interfaces
(BCI) along with computer vision algorithms to achieve extremely fast object detection
at human-level performance, allowing for the triage of large image databases (e.g., 6,7).
Most recently, human-guided machine learning techniques have evolved that shift
humans from the roles of actors to that of technology teachers. Warnell et al (8)
demonstrate this form of human-machine interaction via having a human trainer teach a
deep learning agent to play Atari games using evaluative human feedback called
TAMER (Teaching Agents Manually through Evaluative Reinforcement). Using Deep
TAMER, Atari games can be taught in less than 15 mins; a task that has proven difficult
for state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. At a group level, this form of
interaction is also observed in the commercial sector in selector systems that use inputs,
such as thumbs up or thumbs down, to prioritize playlists, advertisements, etc. A key
finding across all three forms of human-technology relationship described herein is the
demonstration that hybrid intelligence can outperform a machine-only or human-only
approaches under the right conditions.

Focusing on future human-AI ecosystems, Metcalfe et al. (1) argue that the greatest
potential for human-AI partnerships lies in their application to highly complicated
problem spaces. Herein, we embrace a vision of hybrid team intelligence applied in such
complex problem spaces. Our first aim is to articulate three factors driving the types of
problem spaces hybrid team intelligence may solve. Our second aim is to present a vision
for enabling community research with a novel hybrid team intelligence research platform
to enable that vision.
