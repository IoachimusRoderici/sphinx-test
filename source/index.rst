Abstract
--------

Metcalfe et al (1) argue that the greatest potential for human-AI
partnerships lies in their application to highly complex problem spaces. Herein, we
discuss three different forms of hybrid team intelligence and posit that across all
three forms, the hybridization of man and machine intelligence can be effective
under the right conditions. We foresee two significant research and development
(R&D) challenges underlying the creation of effective hybrid intelligence. First,
rapid advances in machine intelligence and/or fundamental changes in human
behaviors or capabilities over time can outpace R&D. Second, the future conditions
under which hybrid intelligence will operate are unknown, but unlikely to be the
same as the conditions of today. Overcoming both of these challenges requires a
deep understanding of multiple human-centric and machine-centric disciplines that
creates a large barrier to entry into the field. Herein, we outline an open, shareable
research platform that creates a form of hybrid team intelligence that functions under
representative future conditions. The intent for the platform is to facilitate new forms
of hybrid intelligence research allowing individuals with human-centric or machine-
centric backgrounds to rapidly enter the field and initiate research. Our hope is that
through open, community research on the platform, state-of-the-art advances in
human and machine intelligence can quickly be communicated across what are
currently different R&D communities and allow hybrid team intelligence research
to stay at the forefront of scientific advancement.
